This is intended to simplify the process of finding the right combination of buttons to activate all lanterns.



This is still very much a work in progress and not fully implimented.
Each of the buttons contains a text field for users to enter in the lantern numbers activated by that button.
The specific format for entering in the button information is the number followed by a space EX: "1 2 3" etc.
Lantern numbers are defined as 1 being the most South East(according to the in game compass) lantern in the building 
and it goes in a clockwise motion as shown below:

When all light information is entered in, (for the time being) The user will have to experiment with different combinations
of buttons in order to turn all lanterns on. Pressing the button associated with the location will toggle the lantern state 
at the bottom of the window. Again for the time being, the user will need to manually keep track of buttons being pressed.
When all lanterns are on, a message will appear Informing them that all are pressed.
Then assuming all the information was input and calculated correctly, you can go around and press all the desired buttons in the game
and then move on in the task of finding the special cammo.
